# llp

A new Flutter project.

# Build

## Linux (mainly for test)

I develop on Fedora. It needed

```bash
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel
```

# TODO

## Next

1. Finish Subscribe button - needs to show subscribed
2. prefs appear to being used for subscriptions - pull out - this is in podcast_detail_screen.dart line 89
3. episode_browser.dart appears to still call api direct - is it still used anyway?
4. Add flashcards to episode
